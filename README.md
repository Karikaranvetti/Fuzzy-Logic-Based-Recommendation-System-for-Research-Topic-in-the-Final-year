# Fuzzy-Logic-Based-Recommendation-System-for-Research-Topic-in-the-Final-year
Most University students are uncertain which research topic to choose for their final year research projects.The students are supposed to learn and demonstrate exceptional skills in problem solving , Analysis , Implementation , presentation and Communication and write reports to graduate with good grades. But the selection of research topics can be over whelming.Hence , they usually look for guidance and support by reaching out to Professors, Seniors and colleagues.However the problem lies in finding an experts available to help the students.Also some experts opinions tend to be related to their experience as well,without taking the students mindset in consideration. In this Project a Fuzzy based recommendation system was implemented to suggest the Final year research topics for the students who are needing it.Recommender systems provide suggestions items to be used to the user.Fuzzy logic is used to handle uncertainty rising from similarities between the majors. Fuzzy logic can provide an effective means for conflict resolution of multiple criteria and better assessment of options. The specific objectives are: 
       ** To identify the features that contribute to maximizing student satisfaction on the Topic choice. 
       **To propose an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) to aid students in the decision making process
